			<p class="lead">
				AIQA is a quality assurance platform designed specifically for AI systems. 
				We make it easy to test, trace, and improve your AI applications.
			</p>

			<h2 class="h3 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">The Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				Generative AI has exploded into mainstream business. ChatGPT, DALL-E, and similar systems 
				are driving innovation across many sectors. But as businesses rely more on AI, quality assurance 
				becomes critical.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, AI systems often receive <strong>less</strong> testing than traditional software, 
				even though they need <strong>more</strong>. They're unpredictable by nature, which makes them 
				harder to test. But that unpredictability is exactly why they need rigorous testing.
			</p>

			<h2 class="h3 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Why Traditional Testing Falls Short</h2>
			<p>
				Traditional software testing assumes deterministic outputs. You write a test, you get a pass or fail. 
				But AI systems don't work that way. They're probabilistic, and the outputs are often subjective.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many teams use an exploratory approach: tweaking prompts and parameters until something looks good. 
				But what works in a demo might fail in production. And without proper testing, you're flying blind.

					It might work out, but it's not a smart risk to take."

			<h2 class="h3 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Our Solution</h2>
			<p>
				AIQA brings data-science QA practices to generative AI. We provide:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Automatic tracing</strong> - Capture inputs, outputs, and performance without changing your workflow</li>
				<li><strong>Experiment management</strong> - Run systematic tests across different scenarios</li>
				<li><strong>OpenTelemetry integration</strong> - Built on industry standards for compatibility</li>
				<li><strong>Multi-language support</strong> - Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Go clients</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="h3 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Our Philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				We believe testing should be:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Simple</strong> - No need to become a testing expert. Just add a decorator and you're tracing.</li>
				<li><strong>Reliable</strong> - Catch issues before they become problems in production.</li>
				<li><strong>Built for AI</strong> - Understands probabilistic systems and subjective outputs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="h3 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Get Involved</h2>
			<p>
				AIQA is open source. We welcome contributions, feedback, and questions. 
				Check out our <a href="https://github.com/winterwell/aiqa">GitHub repository</a> to get started.
